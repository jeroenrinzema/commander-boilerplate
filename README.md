This is a boilerplate project for [commander](https://github.com/sysco-middleware/commander).

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started with commander is to build the docker images via docker-compose.
To run the docker containers check out the README in the `docker` directory.

When wanting to run a commander service manually make sure to have the required dependencies running and the `environment` variables set. Every service has a short documentation about it's workings and which dependencies/environments it requires to run.
