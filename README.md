This is a boilerplate project for [commander](https://github.com/sysco-middleware/commander).

![The pattern](https://github.com/sysco-middleware/commander/wiki/commander-pattern.jpg)

## Getting started

You could run the boilerplate project in 2 ways:

- Build and run the docker containers
- Run every service manually

To run the docker containers check out the README in the `docker` directory.
To run every service manually make sure to have the required dependencies running and the `environment` variables set.
